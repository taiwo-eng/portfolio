					<h1 class="case-text">Quidax is a crytocurrency exchange with a vision to make transfer of value as easy as sending a text message.</h1>

					<p>In 2018, a young entrepreneur who had difficulties sending and recieving cross border payments from clients and businesses in neighboring African countries, started Quidax to take on the task of building the future of money in Africa. Having grown tired of the existing financial systems and regulatory policies, he wanted a secure and quick way to send & receive value.</p> <p> Today, Quidax has evolved to become a platform with robust infrastructure comprising of trading tools and entreprise solutions. It offers this unique blend of solutions to both individuals and businesses.</p>

					<h1 class="case-text">Old Money</h1>

					<p>The history of money as we know it has largely remained the same for the past 200 years. I’ll admit that at different times in that history, incredible innovations and policies have been created to improve the global financial systems in different eras, but these systems have largely benefited the same people for generations. <br><br> The answer to this in many ways is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency enables a new financial system. One that is open, decentralized, inclusive and benefits everybody.</p> <p>Today's businesses still largely operate by the old rules, albeit from a disadvantaged point. The aim of this project was to show to businesses what values lie in the adoption and use of cryptocurrecny for their financial and transactional operations. To make the benefits immediately obvious, I worked with HNIs to design around the needs for their businesses.</p>

					<h1 class="case-text">Role</h1>

					<p>As lead designer on this project, I worked with my team members to create an experience that was both informational and valuable to our business users. Part of this involved creating custom brand illustrations and icons for the different entreprise features.</p><p> For each core feature and business type, I designed a separate web page using a uniform layout I had established with low fidelity wireframes. Because the turnaround time was a constraint, I used the dogfooding technique and moderated usability testing to quickly test and get feedback from the high fidelity prototypes I arrived at.</p> <p>This was a unique project at the time, becuase it started off as a P.O.C that needed to be validated and as such the entire process and team composition from design to engineering was very lean.</p>

					<h1 class="case-text">Back to the basics</h1>

					<p>At the root of every successful transaction - financial or otherwise - lies trust. Trust in who you are transacting with and trust in the channels you use for transactions. The landscape for cryptocurrency in Africa is still largely untrusting, particularly among early adopters of the technology. This is why in coming up with a solution for Quidaxians (what Quidax customers are called) it was necessary to be as transparent as possible, while retaining simplicty and ease of use. <br> <br> For experts & business users, the product experience is slightly more robust when compared to the experience for beginners. For this category of customers, every detail matters, every second of every transaction counts. This is why a suite of business products exist to efficiently manage transactions at scale. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="case-main">
					<h1 class="case-text">Showcasing value for businesses.</h1>

					<p>With business customers, demands are more niche. What works for one business might not necessarily work for another. In creating value at every opportunity we sort out to showcase the power of the Quidax platform as an infrastructure for payments and fintech in Africa. With APIs and entreprise products, businesses enjoy deep customization that cater to their needs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="case-main">
					<h1 class="case-text">Infrastructure for Africa</h1>

					<p>The purpose of the Quidax platform is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, for individuals and businesses irrespective of geographical location. By designing staggered onboarding experiences, customers are able to get value immediately instead of being blocked by numerous processes, thereby bringing the benefits of digital money to everyday life.</p>
