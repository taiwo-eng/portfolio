					<p>The gig economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, with an increasing number of tech talent opting for flexible work arrangements. With Gigster, there was a need for a well-designed app that addressed the pain points faced by Gigster talent and internal stakeholders, such as usability issues, lack of efficient communication channels, and inadequate project management as a result of deprecated systems. The challenge was to redesign a  talent portal that offers a user-friendly experience, encourages trust and collaboration, and ensures smooth operations for all stakeholders.</p>

					<h1 class="case-text">Design</h1>

					<p>To begin, I conducted user interviews, stakeholders interviews, and usability tests with both freelancers and the client to understand their needs, pain points, and expectations. Gathered insights into their preferences regarding profile management, project discovery, communication channels, and project processes.</p>
			    	<p>Examining what the competition was doing required analyzing existing freelancer platforms to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. Explored successful user-centric features, such as intuitive search filters, user ratings and reviews and streamlined onboarding processes.</p>
			    	<p>I developed low-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize the user interface and test key functionalities. Iterated on the designs based on user feedback and usability testing results. I also made sure incorporated responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across devices. For talent, I designed comprehensive profiles that showcases their skills, experience, portfolio, and testimonials. Also took in to consideration verification mechanisms to enhance trust and credibility, such as identity verification and professional certifications.</p>

					<p> Crafted a visually appealing and modern design language that aligns with the platform's brand identity and user preferences. Ensured consistency in typography, color palette, and visual hierarchy to enhance the platform's usability and aesthetic appeal.
I also conducted usability testing with users and clients to gather feedback on the final product. Evaluated the platform's ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction. Iterated on the design based on user feedback, focusing on refining user flows and addressing pain points. We launched the new talent portal with a controlled rollout.</p>
